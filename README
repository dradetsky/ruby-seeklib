ruby-seeklib
============

FFI bindings to allow use of seeklib with ruby. seeklib is basically
an alternative to pHash/pHashion. See here for background:

Unfortunately, it relies on you having seeklib installed already,
since I don't know how to package a library along with a gem (rubygems
only explains extconf-style packaging), and I don't have time to
rewrite it as an extension.

Usage
-----

Seeklib.path_sig: takes a path to an image, and produces an imgseek fingerprint.

Seeklib.calc_diff: takes two imgseek fingerprints and returns the difference score.

Two caveats: 

1. Note that the difference score is not as straightforward as the one
generated by pHash. The score is a negative integer. The more
negative, the more different the images are. It's not clear what the
max difference score is. You should probably look here if you really
need to know:

2. The score resulting from comparing two identical images is
undefined. If this is possible in your application, consider
supplementing your comparison with good old-fashion sha1 or something.
